## Purpose

This project replicates the New Keynesian model composed by Belongia &
Ireland (2020), estimated using Bayesian techniques, to reflect the
recent post-financial-crisis episode of zero nominal interest rates in
the US, and demonstrates the effects of substituting the Federal
Reserve’s traditional policy of managing interest rates with the
alternative of money growth targeting. In addition, the sample is
extended to the most recent data available to test the robustness of the
findings.

For both the benchmark and extended sample, counterfactual simulations
illustrate similar findings to Belongia & Ireland (2020); a rule for
modifying the money growth ratemodestly and gradually in response to
deviations in the output gap has performance levels comparable to the
calibrated interest rate rule in stabilising inflation and output.
Additionally, the impulse responses disclose that, under the same money
growth rule, the US’s post-2008 crisis economic recovery would have been
accelerated due to a significantly shorter period of near-zero nominal
interest rates.

These findings insinuate that, with a binding zero lower bound
constraint, policy rules for money growth can provide a simplistic
method for monetary policy to reduce the uneasiness of monetary policy
efficacy.

## Code

The Bayesian estimmation code was conducted using Dynare. The code can
