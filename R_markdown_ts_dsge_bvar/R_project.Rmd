  This project replicates the New Keynesian model composed by @belongia2020, estimated using Bayesian techniques, to reflect the recent post-financial-crisis episode of zero nominal interest rates in the US, and demonstrates the effects of substituting the Federal Reserve’s traditional policy of managing interest rates with the alternative of money growth targeting. In addition, the sample is extended to the most recent data available to test the robustness of the findings. For both the benchmark and extended sample, counterfactual simulations illustrate similar findings to @belongia2020; a rule for modifying the money growth rate modestly and gradually in response to deviations in the output gap has performance levels comparable to the calibrated interest rate rule in stabilising inflation and output. Additionally, the impulse responses disclose that, under the same money growth rule, the US’s post-2008 crisis economic recovery would have been accelerated due to a significantly shorter period of near-zero nominal interest rates. These findings insinuate that, with a binding zero lower bound constraint, policy rules for money growth can provide a simplistic method for monetary policy to reduce the uneasiness of monetary policy efficacy.

# Introduction

In the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve (Fed) implemented the accustomed expansionary monetary policy strategy of interest rate targeting to spur economic growth and curb rising inflation. This strategy involved the Fed lowering the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the average interest rate banks pay for overnight borrowing in the federal funds market, to ultimately transmit into reduced long-run market rates and increased aggregate demand. However, the efficacy of managing interest rates post-crisis was constrained by the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB). Three waves of unconventional Quantitative Easing were executed as an unorthodox alternative strategy to stabilise output inflation. 

To this extent, @belongia2020 retrospectively investigates the efficacy of money growth targeting as the Fed's monetary policy strategy under the restrictive ZLB in the US, specifically during the crisis-induced global recession. With a similar *modus operandi*, this project conducts Bayesian estimation to replicate the model by @belongia2020 and performs counterfactual simulation analysis with alternative monetary policy rules, namely an interest rate rule, a (flexible) money supply rule, and a constant money supply rule. In addition, Bayesian estimation techniques are conducted on an extended sample, to give an indication of the robustness of the authors' findings.  

For both the benchmark and extended sample the results are similar to that of @belongia2020; impulse response simulations, estimated over the sample data from 1983 up to 2019 (and extended to the end of 2021) on the US economy, show that a (flexible) money growth rule, whereby deviations in the output gap are counteracted with modest and gradual changes to the money growth rate, has efficacy levels comparable to the estimated interest rate rule in stabilising output and inflation. Moreover, under a constant money growth rule, output and inflation illustrate substantially more volatility, consistent with the findings by @ireland2000, @collard2005, and @gali2015.


Crucially, the findings of this project support @belongia2020's counterfactual simulations, disclosing that the US economy would have recovered faster from the crisis-induced recession under the same money growth rule and a significantly shorter period of ground-level interest rates. Additionally, the simulations presented here show that a money growth rule has satisfactory performance in both the good and the bad times. These findings iterate that the Fed, and other monetary authorities, should consider money growth targeting as a strategy during periods whereby the ZLB diminishes the historical and conventional method of interest rate targeting.

The practice of strictly targeting the Federal Funds rate has been the principal monetary policy strategy since the early 1990s, with economic academia also portraying the Fed's policy as one of interest rate management. At the forefront of understanding interest rate control in theory and practice, @taylor1993 presented the renowned policy rate rule (the Taylor rule), which accurately describes the Fed's adjustments to the Federal Funds rate target in response to deviations in the output gap and inflation during the period 1987 to 1992. Moreover, variants of @taylor1993's rule are considered the workhorse structural representation of monetary policy in New Keynesian economics^[Accredited examples of such variants are given by @woodford2012, @gali2015 and @walsh2010].

@ireland2003, @collard2005, @piazzesi2019, and @rupert2019 also illustrate the preference for interest rate management is modern New Keynesian modelling, specifically during successive periods of money demand shocks^[These Taylor rule type specifications are modern variants of the classical contribution by @poole1970, where the variants allow for a dynamic aggregate price level. Therefore, the Taylor rule becomes a natural benchmark for structuring monetary policy in economic models]. Under these circumstances, the evidence reflects that excess volatility in output and inflation is generated when monetary policies impose a constant money growth rate rather than implement interest rate targeting. In these stochastic IS-LM model economies, the added output and price volatility are insulated from the impact of demand shocks under policies of interest rate management. Additionally, by construction, the widely accepted forward-looking specifications of the New Keynesian Phillips curve imply that the sole policy instrument available to monetary authorities in their pursuit to stabilise output and inflation is the power to affect the current and expected future dynamics of the short-term nominal interest rate. Therefore, understandably, the Fed has held the longstanding stance that the workhorse monetary policy strategy is that of interest rate management.  

However, the recent past of interest rates gravitating near-zero has forced monetary authorities globally to find alternative price-and-growth-stabilization tactics. During the periods 2009 to 2015, the Fed's interest rate targeting strategy was constrained by the ZLB, and three rounds of unconventional open market operations in the form of Quantitative Easing were conducted, where interest payments on bank reserves and reverse repurchase agreements for financial institutions are among some other actions taken by the Fed. Therefore, in this pursuit of discovering alternative stabilising strategies that @belongia2020 investigates the targeting of the money stock as a potential monetary policy strategy. As in @belongia2018, this project finds simulated evidence favouring the adoption of money growth management by monetary authorities.

# The Log-Linearized Model


\begin{align}
\hat{c}_t &= \hat{y}_t \label{47}  \\
(z -\beta\lambda)(z-\gamma)\hat{\lambda}_t =\gamma z\hat{y}_{t-1} -(z^2 + &\beta\gamma^2)\hat{y}_t + \beta\gamma z E_t\hat{y}_{t+1} +(z-\beta\gamma\rho_a)(z-\gamma) \hat{a}_t -\gamma z \hat{z}_t \label{48}  \\
\hat{\lambda}_t &= \hat{r}_t +E_t \hat{\lambda}_{t+1} -E_t  \hat{\pi}_{t+1} \label{49}  \\
\gamma z \hat{q}_{t-1} -(z^2 +\beta\gamma^2) \hat{q}_t +&\beta \gamma z E_t  \hat{q}_{t+1} + \beta \gamma(z-\gamma)(1-\rho_a)  \hat{a}_t -\gamma z  \hat{z}_t = 0 \label{50}  \\
\hat{x}_t &= \hat{y}_t - \hat{q}_t \label{51}  \\
(1+\beta \alpha)\hat{\pi}_t &= \alpha \hat{\pi}_{t-1} + \beta E_t  \hat{\pi}_{t+1} -\psi  \hat{\lambda}_t +\psi   \hat{a}_t  + \hat{e}_t \label{52}  \\
\hat{r}_t &= \rho_r  \hat{r}_{t-1} +\rho_\pi   \hat{\pi}_{t-1} + \rho_x   \hat{x}_{t-1} +  \varepsilon_{r t} \label{53}  \\
\delta_r (r-1) \hat{\lambda}_t-\delta_r (r-1) \hat{a}_t - \hat{u}_t +\phi \hat{z}_t &= \phi \hat{m}_{t-1} -\left[\phi(1+\beta) +1 \right] \hat{m}_t +\beta \phi  \hat{m}_{t+1} - \delta_r  \hat{r}_t \label{54}  \\
\hat{\mu}_t &= \hat{z}_t +  \hat{m}_t -  \hat{m}_{t-1} + \hat{\pi}_t \label{55}   \\
\hat{g}_t &= \hat{y}_t -  \hat{y}_{t-1} +   \hat{z}_t \label{56}  \\
\hat{a}_t &= \rho_a  \hat{a}_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{a t} \label{57}  \\    
\hat{z}_t &= \varepsilon_{z t} \label{58}  \\
\hat{u}_t &= \rho_u  \hat{u}_{t-1} +\varepsilon_{u t} \label{59}  \\
\hat{e}_t &= \rho_e  \hat{e}_{t-1} +\varepsilon_{e t} \label{60}  
\end{align}

The final model is a fully specified four-equation New Keynesian(NK) DSGE model that consists of an IS relation , a AD relation, a NK Phillips curve, and a monetary policy function. The monetary policy function is adapted under three distinct specifications, namely, a modified @taylor1993 rule, a zero interest rate rule, and a money growth rule. Excluding the monetary policy function and its specifications, the final model is derived as:

\begin{align}
\hat{x}_t = E_t \hat{x}_{t+1} - (\hat{r}_t - E_t \hat{\pi}_{t+1}) + (1- \rho_a)\hat{a}_t, \label{61} \\
\hat{m}_t = \delta_r (r-1)\hat{y}_t - \delta_r \hat{r}_t + \hat{u}_t,   \label{62} \\
(1+\beta \alpha) \hat{\pi}_t = \alpha \hat{\pi}_{t-1} + \beta E_t \hat{\pi}_{t+1} - \psi \hat{\lambda}_t + \psi \hat{a}_t + \hat{e}_t \label{63}.
\end{align}

Equation (\ref{61}) represents the model's NK IS relationship, formulated by combining equations (\ref{48}) - (\ref{51}), that relates the real interest rate $\hat{r}_t - E_t \hat{\pi}_{t+1}$ to deviations in the output gap $\hat{x}_t$. Here, the special case of zero habit formation in consumption ($\gamma=0$) is applied to simplify the relation (\ref{61}) is purely-forward looking. 

Again, in adopting the special case of zero habit formation in consumption and adjustment costs for real balances in the money demand relationship (\ref{54}), so that $\gamma=0$ and $\phi_m=0$, yields the final NK AD relationship (\ref{62}). In this specification, $\delta_r$ is the interest semi-elasticity of money demand and $u_t$ represents a shock to money demand. Importantly, for relatively low levels of the steady state nominal interest rate, the coefficient on $\hat{y}_t$ will be small, and therefore the demand for real money balances depends more heavily on $Z_t$, the permanent component of income, than on the transitory component of income, captured by $\hat{y}_t$.

The NK Phillips curve is given by equation \ref{63}, and includes a backward-looking component $\alpha \hat{\pi}_{t-1}$ when $\alpha > 0$, such that the price stickiness of individual goods are indexed to past inflation. The following subsections  completes the model under the different specifications for the monetary policy function.   

## Monetary Policy Specification 1: The Taylor Rule 

The first specification for the monetary policy function is the modified @taylor1993 rule given by equation \ref{53}, re-copied here:

\begin{align}
\hat{r}_t &= \rho_r  \hat{r}_{t-1} +\rho_\pi   \hat{\pi}_{t-1} + \rho_x   \hat{x}_{t-1} +  \varepsilon_{r t}, \label{s1}
\end{align}

where $\rho_r$ is the interest rate smoothing parameter, with $\rho_\pi$ and $\rho_x$ representing the severity of monetary policy's response to deviations in inflation and the output gap, respectively. 


## Monetary Policy Specification 2: The Flexible Money Growth Rule 

As an alternative monetary policy instrument, when monetary authorities are unable to lower the policy rate due to the ZLB, @belongia2020 specifies a money growth rule as:

\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_t = \rho_{mm} \hat{\mu}_{t-1} + \rho_{m \pi} \hat{\pi}_{t-1} +\rho_{mx} \hat{x}_{t-1}, \label{s2}
\end{align}

where $\rho_{mm}$ represents the money growth smoothing parameter, with $\rho_{m \pi}$ and $\rho_{mx}$ the severity of monetary policy's money growth response to deviations in inflation and the output gap ,respectively.In the case that  $\rho_{m \pi} <0$ and $\rho_{mx} <0$, the money growth rate rule gives the monetary authority the ability to actively stabilize inflation and the output gap in response to exogenous shocks that stuns the economy. In addition, if $\rho_{mm}>0$, the money growth rule (\ref{s2}) dictates a gradual response in money growth following deviations in inflation and the output gap in a similar fashion that interest rate smoothing $\rho_r$ does in the @taylor1993 rule given by (\ref{s1}).  

## Monetary Policy Specification 3: The Constant Money Growth Rule 

In the case that $\rho_{mm} = \rho_{m \pi}= \rho_{mx}=0$, (\ref{s2}) is narrowed to the constant money growth rule advocated for by @friedman1968, and further studied in @ireland2000, @collard2005, and @gali2015. As will be motivated in section \ref{data} below, the flexible money growth rate (\ref{s2}) is replaced by the constant money growth rate: 

\begin{align}
\hat{\mu}_t = 1.0136. \label{s3}
\end{align}


# Data and Calibration of Steady State \label{data}

All data used to estimate the model are quarterly, with the benchmark sample running in tandem to @belongia2020 from 1983:1 through 2019:1. Additionally, the extended sample runs from 1983:1 through 2020:4. The estimation method treats four of the model's variables as observable, gathered using US macroeconomic time series data drawn from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' FRED database, and is depicted in Figure \ref{timeseries} below. 

The short-term nominal interest rate $\hat{r}_t$ is measured by the effective federal funds rate, scaled by 400 to transform the data to quarterly rates as in the model. Output growth ($\hat{g}_t$) is measured as the quarterly changes in the per capita natural log of real GDP.^[Population is measured as ages 16 and over of the non-institutional civilian population.]  Inflation $\hat{\pi}_t$ is measured as the quarterly changes in the log of the GDP deflator. Lastly, the quarterly changes in the Divisia M2 index of money, scaled to per capita terms, measures the nominal money growth rate $\hat{\mu}_t$. 

During the periods from 2009:1 through 2015:4 the FED held short-term nominal interest rates close to zero, following @belongia2020, the @taylor1993 specification (\ref{s1}) is replaced by the following zero interest rate condition in the estimated model:
\begin{align}
\hat{r}_t = - \ln(r). \label{67}

```


The model is estimated in its log-linearized form as stated by equation (\ref{47})-(\ref{60}) above. Therefore, pre-estimation, the calibration strategy treats the steady state variables of inflation ($\pi$), nominal interest rate ($r$), and output growth ($g=z$) as exogenously observable. These values for both the benchmark and extended sample is given in Table \ref{steadystated}, and is calculated as the mean values of the respective sample data. However, for the steady state nominal interest rate ($r$), I apply the strategy used by @ireland2011, and is calculated as $r = \frac{(z \pi)}{\beta}$. Finally, the adopted discount factor ($\beta$) of 0.9987, marginally smaller than assumed by @belongia2020, is as in the models presented in @ireland2011, @gali2015, and @rupert2019.

Importantly, when simulating (for the benchmark sample) and estimating (for the extended sample) the structural model under the flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2}), I calibrate the parameters as in @belongia2020. That is, the parameters for money growth smoothing ($\rho_{mm}= 1$), and the severity of the policy's response to deviations in inflation ($\rho_{m \pi}=0$) and the output gap ($\rho_{mx}= -0.125$). Money growth smoothing ($\rho_{mm}$) is normalised, combined with the negative policy response output gap deviations ($\rho_{mx}$), permitting the monetary authority to actively stabilise the output gap in response to exogenous shocks that maim the economy similarly to interest rate smoothing ($\rho_r$) role in the @taylor1993 rule  (\ref{s2}). However, it is assumed that policy doesn't actively respond to deviations in inflation as $\rho_{m \pi} = 0$.

The constant money growth specification for monetary policy (\ref{s3}) implies the case where  $\rho_{mm} = \rho_{m \pi}= \rho_{mx}=0$, and the flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2}) is transformed into the constant money growth rule advocated for by @friedman1968. In this specification, the (gross) constant money growth rate is set to equal to $1.0136$ based on the estimated findings by @ireland2011 and justified by the similar implementations by @beck2008 and @gali2015^[See @castelnuovo2012 and @tarassow2019 for an in-depth analysis of the intricacies surrounding estimating constant money growth values for the US.].

# Priors and Bayesian Estimation

The priors for the remaining 16 structural parameters are set to match that of @belongia2020. The priors and posterior estimates under the @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s1}) for both the benchmark and extended samples are given in Table \ref{priors_posterior}, and is plotted in more detail in Figures \ref{posterior1} in \ref{aa} and \ref{posterior_extended1} in \ref{bb} for the benchmark sample and extended sample, respectively. Additionally, under the same priors, the posterior estimates for the extended sample under the flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2}) is given in Table \ref{priors_posterior_money} and is plotted in more detail \ref{posterior_extended2} in \ref{cc}.

## Blanchard-Khan Stability Conditions

The assumption that macroeconomic models assume perfect foresight has been widely critiqued. However, the assumption has been made possible due to improvement of simulation algorithms. For the model to have a unique solution, the Blanchard-Khan conditions have to be met. These conditions are easy to check, in terms of eigenvalues computed at the steady state of the model. This unique solution for the model is determined if and only if the number of unstable eigenvalues is equal to the number of non-predetermined variables. The Blanchard-Khan condition for the DSGE model of this project is satisfied as there are five eigenvalues larger than one in the modulus for five forward looking variables in the model.

The estimations mode check plots for the benchmark sample @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s1}), the extended sample @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s2}), and flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2}) is depicted in Figure \ref{mc1} in \ref{aa}, Figure \ref{mc2} in \ref{bb}, and Figure \ref{mc3} in \ref{cc}, respectively. The differences in the shape between the likelihood kernel and the posterior likelihood indicate the role of the prior in influencing the curvature of the likelihood function. Ideally, the estimated mode should be at the maximum of the posterior likelihood. These plots further confirms that the Blanchard-Khan conditions have been met for all three estimations. 

## Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) Convergence Diagnostics

For all three estimation specifications the number of Metropolis-Hastings Chains is set to two, corresponding to 25 000 draws, with the respective acceptance ratio's given in Table \ref{ar} below. Since the DSGE model specified has more than five parameters, we would expect to see an acceptance ratio of around 23 percent according to @bedard2008optimal. This is clearly satisfied for all three estimations. 

In addition, the estimated @brooks1998 MCMC multivariate and univariate convergence diagnostic plots for the benchmark sample @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s1}), the extended sample @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s2}), and flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2}) is depicted in Figures \ref{mcmcm1} and \ref{mcmcu2} in \ref{aa}, Figures \ref{mcmcm2} and \ref{mcmcu2} in \ref{bb}, and Figures \ref{mcmcm3} and \ref{mcmcu3} in \ref{cc}, respectively. For each estimation procedure, the chains for the multivariate and univariate convergence diagnostic plots converges and stabilises horizontally, and are clearly satisfactory.

# Analysis of Results- Impulse Responses


The benchmark sample impulse response function comparissons for the estimated @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s1}), and the calibrated-to-match these structural parameter estimates flexible money growth rule (\ref{s3}) and constant money growth rule (\ref{s3}) following a one-standard-deviation preference, productivity, money demand, and cost-push shock are illustrated by Figure \ref{irf1}. With some minor differences, the results are strikingly similar to that reported by @belongia2020. 

Importantly, the extended sample impulse response functions are provided in Figure \ref{irf2} in \ref{bb}, however, yields similar dynamics in response to the above-mentioned shocks than the benchmark sample. Therefore, I only analyse the impulse response in Figure \ref{irf1} below. 

## Comparisson to flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2})

The benchmark sample impulse response function comparissons for the estimated @taylor1993 rule (\ref{s1}), and the calibrated-to-match these structural parameter estimates flexible money growth rule (\ref{s3}) and constant money growth rule (\ref{s3}) following a one-standard-deviation preference, productivity, money demand, and cost-push shock are illustrated by Figure \ref{irf1}. With some minor differences, the results are strikingly similar to that reported by @belongia2020. 

In response to an expansionary preference shock depicted in column $(a)$ of Figure \ref{irf1}, both the Taylor rule and the flexible money growth rule results in monetary tightening through increased interest rates and decreased money supply growth. Under both rules, the monetary tightening effectively eradicates the inflationary effects induced by the preference shock and assists in stabilising output growth and the output gap. 

The impulse response functions illustrated in column $(d)$ of Figure \ref{irf1} are consistent with the findings by @ireland2003; following a productivity shock under sticky prices, the Taylor rule specification for monetary policy necessitates an increase in money growth to instigate the systematic increase in output growth while holding the output gap unvaried. Similarly, in response to such an accommodating productivity shock, the flexible money growth rule dictates a monetary expansion that grants a more efficient output recovery, minimising the severity of inflation's response. 

Moreover, column $(c)$ of Figure \ref{irf1} shows that by maintaining a fixed short-term nominal rate, the Taylor rule cushions output growth, inflation, and the output gap by wholly accommodating a money demand shock^[This result corroborates the conclusions in the classic Keynesian analysis by @poole1970.]. However, this ideal is not present under the flexible money growth rule. The nominal interest rate instantly jumps to a higher level as the money demand shock hits the model economy. Nevertheless, the flexible money growth rule still encompasses a persistent increase in money growth, which accommodates the increase in the demand for money balances. Finally, the impulse responses following a cost-push shock depicted in $(b)$ of Figure \ref{irf1} show that the flexible money growth rule has near-identical dynamics to the Taylor rule.

Each column shows the percentage-point response of the indicated variable to a one-standard-deviation $\sigma_i$,for $i=a_t, z_t, u_t, e_t$, under the estimated Taylor rule (\ref{s1}), the flexible money growth rule (\ref{s2}),and the constant money growth rule (\ref{s3}).}
  \label{irf1}
\end{figure}

## Comparisson to constant money growth rule (\ref{s3})

The constant money growth rule (\ref{s3}) represents the case where  $\rho_{mm} = \rho_{m \pi}= \rho_{mx}=0$ is applied to the flexible money growth rule (\ref{s3}). Additionally, as motivated in section \ref{data}, the (gross) constant money growth rate $\hat{\mu}_t$ is set equal to 1.0136 as in @ireland2011. The estimated prior and posterior distributions under the constant money growth rule by @ireland2000, @collard2005, @gali2015, and @belongia2020 indicate that macroeconomic volatility would have been severely escalated if the Fed had followed a constant money growth rule as specified here. Specifically, @belongia2020 finds that median estimates of the standard deviations of output growth and inflation are more than $50$ per cent larger under this constant money growth rule than under the conventional Taylor rule. The impulse response functions under this constant money growth rule, given in Figure \ref{irf1}, supports these authors' findings, and the analysis is discussed below.

In general, the efficacy of the constant money growth rule, simulated in  Figure \ref{irf1}, performs rather poorly, especially relative to both the estimated Taylor and flexible money growth rules. The constant money growth rule fails to exhibit the monetary tightening induced by both the Taylor and flexible money growth rules. Therefore, output growth, inflation, and the output gap under constant money growth illustrate substantially more volatility in response to a preference shock column $(a)$ of Figure \ref{irf1}. 

Similarly, column $(d)$ of Figure \ref{irf1} shows that in response to an accommodative productivity shock, the constant money growth rule is absent of the gradual increase in money growth that facilitates an efficient recovery in the economy evident in both the Taylor rule and the flexible money growth rule. As a result, even though the output gap and inflation are more volatile, output growth notably exhibits more stability in the case of a constant money growth rule in response to a productivity shock. 

In stark contrast to the Taylor and flexible money growth rule, column $(c)$ of Figure \ref{irf1} shows that the constant money growth rule permits money demand shocks to exacerbate macroeconomic volatility. 

Lastly, some positives can be drawn from column $(b)$ of Figure \ref{irf1}, illustrating that the constant money growth rule performs moderately better than the Taylor and flexible money growth rules in stabilising inflation in response to a cost-push shock. However, this inflation stability comes at the cost of permitting substantially more significant output growth and output gap variability. 

The literature consensus indicates that QE lowers longer-term interest rates through a central bank balance sheet re-balancing channel on the term premium, which in turn generates expansionary effects on output and inflation [@borio2018; and @carlson2020]. Therefore, assuming some combination of a flexible or constant money growth rule and a rule for central bank open market operations is undoubtedly attractive for future studies; however, it is outside the scope of this project ^[See @gertler2011, @gertler2018, and @bernanke2020 for possible QE rules that can be combined with money growth rules for monetary policy.].


# Analysis of Results- Estimated Smoothed Variables

The green lines represent the deciles of the one step ahead forecast distribution.}
\label{smoothed}
\end{figure}

The Bayesian estimates of the smoothed variables (“best guess for the observed variable given all observations”), derived from the Kalman smoother at the posterior mean are shown in Figure \ref{smoothed} for the benchmark sample Taylor rule, and the extended sample Taylor rule and flexible money growth rule in columns $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$, respectively. Once the sample has been extended, the Taylor rule performs similar than under the benchmark sample, with the exception of exhibiting significantly less volatility in the output gap.

However, the main findings of @belongia2020 are still apparent when the sample is extended; The flexible money growth rule could have caused the US economy to regain its strength quicker following the the 2008-9 recession, with a significantly shorter period of extraordinarily low interest rates. 


# Conclusion

This project replicates model by @belongia2020 using Bayesian estimation techniques and performs simulation analysis with alternative monetary policy rules, namely an estimated interest rate rule, a (flexible) money supply rule, and a constant money supply rule. In addition, the sample is extended, to verify the robustness of the authors' findings.

The estimated results are similar to that of @belongia2020; impulse response simulations, estimated using sample data from 1983:1 up to 2019:1 on the US economy, show that a (flexible) money growth rule, whereby deviations in the output gap are counteracted with modest and gradual changes to the money growth rate, has efficacy levels comparable to the estimated interest rate rule in stabilising output and inflation. Moreover, under a constant money growth rule, output and inflation illustrate substantially more volatility, consistent with the findings by @ireland2000, @collard2005, and @gali2015.

Crucially, the findings of this project support @belongia2020's counterfactual simulations, disclosing that the US economy would have recovered faster from the crisis-induced recession under the same money growth rule and a significantly shorter period of ground-level interest rates. Additionally, the simulations presented here show that a money growth rule has satisfactory performance in both the good and the bad times. These findings iterate that the Fed, and other monetary authorities, should consider money growth targeting as a strategy during periods whereby the ZLB diminishes the historical and conventional method of interest rate targeting.
